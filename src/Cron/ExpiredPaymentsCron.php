/**
 * Daily cleanup of stale pending ifthenpay Pay By Link payments.
 *
 * ifthenpay's own hosted Pay By Link page stops accepting the payment once the
 * "expire days" sent when the link was created has passed (see
 * Builder\Process::handle_process()) — a WPForms payment row left "pending" past that
 * point can never be completed, and would otherwise stay pending forever. This sweeps
 * those rows once a day, mirroring the daily expiry cron used by
 * ifthenpay-payments-for-contactform7 (Activation + EntryRepository::mark_expired_pending())
 * and ifthenpay-payments-for-surecart (Setup\ExpiredPaymentsCron).
 *
 * WPForms core has no "expired" payment status — see
 * WPForms\Db\Payments\ValueValidator::get_allowed_one_time_statuses() — so a swept
 * payment is marked "failed" instead. That's already a non-terminal status a later
 * ifthenpay webhook can still resolve to "completed" (see
 * Builder\Process::mark_wpforms_payments_status()), the same way a Multibanco/Payshop
 * reference reported cancelled/failed can still genuinely get paid afterwards.
