Adds ifthenpay payment methods to WPForms: cards, wallets, and local payment options; supports secure one-time payments via pay-by-link.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates the ifthenpay payment gateway with WPForms to enable seamless payment collection directly from your forms. Payments are processed through a secure pay-by-link system, ensuring that no sensitive card or banking data is stored on your website. Customers can complete payments using their preferred method via a secure payment page.

In plain terms you get:
* One-time payments through WPForms
* Support for orders
* Merchant backoffice (basic sales) on web + mobile
* Automatic payment confirmations (no card numbers stored)

All settings are managed within WPForms and your ifthenpay Backoffice. The plugin is designed so store owners can handle payments without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

== Key Features ==

1. Full integration with WPForms lite and pro payment fields
2. Secure transactions
3. Automatic payment confirmation (fast access)
4. Support for multiple payment methods (cards, wallets, transfers)
5. Coupon and discount support via WPForms
6. Secure full-page redirect to ifthenpay's hosted payment page
7. Real-time payment status in WPForms
8. Multi-language support (EN, ES, FR, PT)
9. Security-first approach (no card data stored)

== Requirements ==
* An active ifthenpay merchant account.
* A Gateway Key configured for WPForms (request via ifthenpay support).
* Backoffice Key
* WordPress 6.5+ and PHP 8.2+, with WPForms installed and activated.
* HTTPS (SSL) enabled on your site.

== Installation ==
1. Install: Upload the plugin zip via Plugins → Add New → Upload, or install from WordPress.org and Activate.
2. Credentials: Ensure your ifthenpay account has an active WPForms Gateway Key with desired payment methods enabled.
3. Setup: Go to WPForms → Settings → Payments and enter your Backoffice Key.
4. Form config: Create/Edit a form → Payments tab → Add the Ifthenpay field on your form → enable "ifthenpay | Payment Gateway" and select a Gateway Key.
5. Confirmation messages: In the same Payments tab, customize the Popup Confirmation Messages shown to customers for each payment outcome (Paid, Pending, Failed, Cancelled).

== Popup Confirmation Messages ==

Each ifthenpay-enabled form has its own Popup Confirmation Messages, configured in Create/Edit a form → Payments tab. These control what customers see in the ifthenpay payment popup for each outcome, and are separate from — and not affected by — WPForms' own Confirmations tab.

* Customize the message shown for each of the four outcomes: Paid, Pending, Failed, and Cancelled. Each one is pre-filled with sensible default text that you can edit or leave as-is.
* For the Paid outcome only, choose a Confirmation Type: show a Message in the popup, redirect to a WPForms Page, or redirect to a Redirect URL — the same flexibility as WPForms' native confirmations.
* Optionally enable "Show entry preview after confirmation message" on the Paid outcome, so customers see a summary of their submitted entry right after the payment confirmation message.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin support recurring payments? =
No. This version supports only one-time payments via pay-by-link.

= Are payment details stored? =
No. The plugin does not store card numbers or full banking details. Only minimal references required for payment matching are stored.

= Which payment methods are supported? =
Any method enabled on your ifthenpay Gateway Key (e.g. Multibanco, MB WAY, Payshop, Credit Card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Pix).

= How does the payment process work? =
Customers submit a WPForm and are redirected to a secure ifthenpay-hosted payment page. After completing payment, ifthenpay sends a callback to update the payment status automatically.

= Can I use WPForms coupons? =
Yes. WPForms coupon and total fields are fully supported and automatically processed.

= What happens if a payment fails? =
The entry is marked as Failed. Customers can retry payment depending on your form setup.

= Can I customize the payment experience? =
Yes. You can configure button label, payment description, and styling via WPForms, plus a separate Popup Confirmation Message for each payment outcome (Paid, Pending, Failed, Cancelled). See "Popup Confirmation Messages" above.

= What happens if my form also has another payment gateway field (PayPal, Stripe, Square, Authorize.Net)? =
WPForms only allows one active payment method per submission, so the ifthenpay field automatically hides itself (logo, methods, and "Pay now" button) while another gateway's field is visible on the form. It reappears automatically if that other field is hidden again, e.g. by conditional logic. Only PayPal, Stripe, Square, and Authorize.Net fields count as competing gateways; WPForms' own Total, Coupon, and payment item fields do not.

= Is there a sandbox? =
ifthenpay may provide test entities; if unavailable, use a low-value live test.

= How secure is the integration? =
All requests are encrypted over HTTPS; no sensitive card data is stored.

= Does ifthenpay's addon for WPForms accept WEBHOOKS(Callbacks)? =
Yes! ifthenpay's addon for WPForms from version 2.0.0 and future ones accepts webhook(callbacks).

== External Services ==

== Changelog ==
= 2.0.1 =
*Fixed: Sanitization function bug on the callback url.*

= 2.0.0 =
*Added: full webhook (callback) support — ifthenpay now notifies the site directly when a payment resolves, instead of relying on the customer's browser returning to the site.
*Added: customizable Popup Confirmation Messages per payment outcome (Paid, Pending, Failed, Cancelled), configurable per form in the Payments tab. For the Paid outcome, choose a Confirmation Type — show a message in the popup, redirect to a WPForms page, or redirect to a custom URL — plus an optional entry preview shown after the message.
*Added: two ready-made ifthenpay form templates (Simple and multi-page Complex), available from Add New Form with branded thumbnails.
*Added: an "ifthenpay" light/dark theme preset selectable from WPForms' Themes tab.
*Added: a daily cron that automatically expires stale "pending" payments left behind by abandoned or timed-out Pay By Link sessions.
*Changed: payments now use a full-page redirect to ifthenpay's hosted payment page instead of the legacy modal/popup display; the unused transaction ID tracking that display relied on was removed.
*Changed: when another WPForms payment gateway field (PayPal, Stripe, Square, Authorize.Net) is active on the form, the ifthenpay field now hides itself instead of showing a warning message.
*Changed: a saved default payment method is now ignored if it's no longer enabled on the gateway, falling back to an available method instead of keeping a stale default.
*Fixed: a real, non-zero order could be rejected with "Amount cannot be lower than 0" — a stray or empty submitted quantity for a field that doesn't actually support quantities (e.g. a payment checkbox) was being trusted and could zero out the total. Quantity is now only read from fields that have quantity enabled, matching WPForms' own core logic.
*Fixed: pending, cancelled, and failed Pay By Link attempts now create a real WPForms entry and payment record (previously only completed payments did), so they show up correctly in Payments and Entries.
*Fixed: the payment outcome popup no longer reopens on its own after being dismissed, e.g. when switching back to the browser tab, unless the payment status actually changed.
*Security: payment completion is now confirmed exclusively via the verified webhook, rather than trusting the customer's browser return.
